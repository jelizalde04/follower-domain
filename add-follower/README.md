# Follower Microservice with WebHook â€“ Spring Boot + Swagger

This project is a microservice developed in Java with Spring Boot, designed to manage the action of following (giving "follow") between users. When a user follows another, a notification is sent to another system via a WebHook.

## Key Features

- Exposes a REST endpoint (`POST /followers`) to register a new follower.
- Verifies that the user has not already followed the same profile.
- Registers the follow relationship in a many-to-many table.
- Sends a WebHook notification to another service when a user follows another.
- Uses Swagger UI for interactive documentation and API testing.
